# employee-tracker

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build an content management system to track, view, and update employee databases. Users can view all employees, departments, and roles in the database, as well as update employee information, add departments, and new roles. This system is a simple and easy way to keep track of company personnel and allows managers to have the autonomy to update their teams themselves on the fly.

This project was generated using MySQL and Node.js.
